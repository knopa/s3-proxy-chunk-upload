# S3ProxyChunkUpload

A microservice that lets you upload S3 files in smaller chunks
# Description

When your mobile application stores files on Amazon S3, 
you can run into problems with repeatedly trying to upload files when your users have poor or unstable network connections. <br/>
Amazon S3 supports chunked uploading, but each chunk must be 5 MB or more. <br/>
In most cases, files sent via mobile apps are smaller than 5 MB, and so a different approach is needed.  <br/>
To solve the problem of repeated attempts to upload a file to S3 storage, we have developed S3ProxyChunkUpload, 
a proxy server that sits between your application and Amazon S3.

# Features!


  - Upload files of any size in any number of chunks to Amazon S3 storage
  - Compress uploaded files
  - Convert files to different formats


> The S3ProxyChunkUpload app allows you to upload a file in any number of chunks – 
> and those chunks can be of any size.
> By uploading in chunks, part of a file may be successfully uploaded
> even if a user has a slow internet connection or the connection drops,
> and other parts of the file can be sent when the connection is restored.

 
After each chunk of a file is successfully uploaded to the proxy server, 
a response is sent by the proxy server to your app to keep tabs on the status of the upload. 
After all chunks of a file are uploaded, they are combined on the proxy server to create a source file that is then sent to Amazon S3.


### Installation
---
S3ProxyChunkUpload requires [PlayFramework](https://www.playframework.com/) v2.5.0+.

Install the dependencies and start the server:

```sh
$ cd s3-proxy-chunk-upload
$ activator run
```

### Tech
---

S3ProxyChunkUpload relies on a number of open source projects:

* [PlayFramework] – lightweight, stateless, web-friendly architecture
* [Postgresql] | [Mysql] – open source database
* [SBT] – interactive build tool

And of course, S3ProxyChunkUpload is open source itself, with a [public repository][s3proxychunkupload]
 on GitHub.

   
   ### Configurations (application.conf)
   ---
  - db.default.driver = org.postgresql.Driver
  - db.default.url = "postgres://postgres:chunkupload@localhost/s3proxychunkupload"
  - DB_TYPE = "postgres"
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY (access key for AWS)
  - AWS_SECRET_KEY (secret key for AWS)
  - AWS_S3_BUCKET = "com.s3proxy.posts" - bucket name
  - AWS_S3_HOST  = "s3.amazonaws.com" (hostname)
  - UPLOAD_FOLDER  = "/s3proxychunkupload/upload" (directory where temporary files will be located)
  ##### Notifications
 - SEND_UPLOAD_STATUS_URL  = ""
 - SEND_CONVERT_STATUS_URL = "http://s3proxychunkupload.com/video/convert"
  ##### Video conversion
 - AWS_ET_END_POINT        = "elastictranscoder.us.amazonaws.com"
 - VIDEO_PIPELINE_ID       = "0000000000000-xxxxxx"
 - VIDEO_PRESETS           = {"stream" = "0000000000000-xxxxxx"} (to disable the conversion functionality, do not use this option)
